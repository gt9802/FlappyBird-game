What is Flappy Bird?
Flappy Bird is a popular mobile game that became a viral sensation in 2013. It was a simple, yet addictive game where the player controls a bird and tries to navigate it through a series of pipes. 

The bird automatically moves forward, and the player taps the screen to make the bird flap its wings, causing it to rise momentarily. 
The objective is to avoid colliding with the pipes and stay alive for as long as possible, earning points for passing through gaps in the pipes.
